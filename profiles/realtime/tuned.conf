# This should be tuned if CPU 0 is not fast enough to run all non-realtime
# tasks on the system (including kernel tasks like storage I/O).

# In a NUMA system, keeping one CPU on each NUMA node available to handle
# system tasks and IRQs ensures that every device IRQ can be handled by a
# CPU on the same NUMA node as the device itself.

# In the example below, CPUs 0 and 1 are kept available for system use
# leading to "isolcpus=2-23 nohz_full=2-23"

# # lscpu | grep ^NUMA
# NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22
# NUMA node1 CPU(s):     1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23
